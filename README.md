# GitHub Mentions App

A small app to help Hypha members track their GitHub mentions.

## How It Works

Assumptions:
- When @mentioned by username in GitHub issues, our attention is being requested.
- We're expected to acknowledge reading, even if we don't have anything to say.

When you enter your credentials, the app will pull up comments you've been **@mentioned** in by username, but 2) **haven't reacted** to yet.

Click through to the issue and react to the message in question to make the comment disappear the app on next refresh! :tada:
